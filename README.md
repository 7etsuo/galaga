## Scoring

- Bee: 100 points
- Butterfly: 150 points
- Boss: 300 points

## Tips & Strategy

1. **Build Combos** - Focus fire on tight enemy groups for big multipliers
2. **Save Bombs** - Use them when surrounded or in emergency
3. **Charge Specials** - Perfect for clearing tough formations
4. **Stack Powerups** - Multiple active powerups = unstoppable
5. **Watch Dive Patterns** - Learn to predict enemy attacks
6. **Prioritize Bosses** - They're worth the most points and drop better powerups
7. **Stay Mobile** - Keep moving to avoid enemy bullet patterns

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C (GNU C99)
- **Rendering**: Raw ANSI escape codes with double buffering
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS with fixed timestep
- **Input**: Non-blocking keyboard input with key decay timers
- **Colors**: 256-color ANSI palette

### Architecture
- Modular design with separate systems:
  - Terminal rendering and buffer management
  - Input handling with simultaneous key support
  - Entity management (player, enemies, bullets, powerups)
  - Collision detection (AABB)
  - Enemy AI (formations, dives, capture logic)
  - Game state management
  - Bonus stage system

## Development

Built using modern C best practices:
- Elimination of magic numbers
- Descriptive constants and enums
- Clean separation of concerns
- POSIX compliance for portability

## Known Issues

- Requires terminal with proper ANSI support
- Best experience on 80x24 terminal or larger
- Some terminal emulators may have slight rendering differences
